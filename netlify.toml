[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"
  functions = "netlify/functions"
```
Actually, the safest way is to use the command prompt to create it. Run this:
```
notepad netlify.toml
```
It will ask "do you want to create a new file?" — click **Yes**. Then paste the content above and save.
Then push again:
```
git add .
git commit -m "fix netlify toml"
git push
